# Force client-side SSL redirection.
#
# If a user types `example.com` in their browser, even if the server
# redirects them to the secure version of the website, that still leaves
# a window of opportunity (the initial HTTP connection) for an attacker
# to downgrade or redirect the request.
#
# The following header ensures that browser will ONLY connect to your
# server via HTTPS, regardless of what the users type in the browser's
# address bar.
#
# (!) Remove the `includeSubDomains` optional directive if the website's
# subdomains are not using HTTPS.
